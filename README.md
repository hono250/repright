## User Journey - (for concept: ProgressionGuidance)
Yannick has been stuck at 185lbs bench press for four weeks. He opens Repright and navigates to the Exercise History screen for the workout and taps "Get AI Recommendation." The system sends his past 4 weeks of workout data to the LLM, which analyzes the plateau pattern and returns a recommendation to deload to 155lbs with detailed reasoning about recovery and progression. Yannick reviews the AI's explanation, taps "Apply," and his next workout session is pre-filled with the recommended weight and reps, allowing him to execute the deload strategy immediately.
